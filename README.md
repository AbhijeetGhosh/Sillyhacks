# Silly Cam

This contains, the App of Silly Cam's code. Me with my team built this for international Silly Hacks Competition. Given the task of building something that employed a silly but really fun idea and was an efficient and good quality product, Silly-Cam won us the competition. 

## Description

This app has been coded in  Flutter,Dart. Containing a beautiful GUI it provides just the right face for an equally beautiful algorithm.
It generates Viral meme videos, with the face entered by the user morphed into the video's character.

Here is a demonstration, dictated by my team-mate on how the app worked! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJF26Yf6Pfg&feature=emb_logo

## Features of this!
  1. User authentication and profile generation
  2. Let's the user select a photo of their or their friend.
  3. Connects to the API, built by me to a google cloud virtual machine containing the algorithm.
  4. The G-cloud vm generates a viral video with the face entered by user morphed in the main character
  5. The app recieves the video and saves it on user's phone.
